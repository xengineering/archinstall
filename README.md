# archinstall

This repository is intended to provide an installation script for Arch Linux so that it can be used during the installation process.

Note: There are many Arch Install scripts out there but I wanted to create my own for an educational purpose. So it's mainly a personal repository, but if you like the script or want to contribute, you're welcome to use it.


## Usage

1. Download the Arch Linux .iso file (maybe [here](http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/archlinux/iso/latest/)) and verify it.
2. Write the .iso to an USB stick (maybe with this [tool](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)) and boot the machine from this USB stick in UEFI mode.
3. Download the script with 'curl -L archinstall.xengineering.eu > archinstall.sh'.
4. Run the script with 'bash archinstall.sh' and follow the instructions.


### Hint for German Users

Execute 'loadkeys de-latin1' after booting to live environment, if you want to set a german keyboard layout. You have to type 'z' for 'y' in loadkeys and 'ÃŸ' for the '-' sign.


### Usage with VirtualBox

1. Create a VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) for 64-bit Arch Linux with the default or customized settings.
2. Enable Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) in the settings of this VM.
3. Start the VM and provide the .iso file if you are asked to.
4. You booted the Arch Linux live environment in VirtualBox. Proceed with the normal use of archinstall.
