# archinstall

This repository is intended to provide an installation script for Arch Linux so that it can be used during the installation process.

Note: There are many Arch Install scripts out there but I wanted to create my own for an educational purpose. So it's mainly a personal repository, but if you like the script or want to contribute, you're welcome to use it.


## Usage

1. Download the Arch Linux .iso file (maybe [here](http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/archlinux/iso/latest/)) and verify it.
2. Write the .iso file to an USB stick (maybe with this [tool](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)) and boot the machine from this USB stick (you could also boot a virtual machine with this .iso file).
3. Change your keyboard layout, if needed (mind the section below).
4. Download the script with 'curl -L archinstall.xengineering.eu > archinstall.sh'.
5. Edit the 'Settings' section with 'nano archinstall.sh', save (CTRL + o) and leave (CTRL + x) the nano editor.
6. Run the script with 'bash archinstall.sh'.


### Change your Keyboard Layout

#### German Keyboard Layout

Execute 'loadkeys de-latin1' after booting to live environment, if you want to set a german keyboard layout. You have to type 'z' for 'y' in loadkeys and 'ÃŸ' for the '-' sign.
